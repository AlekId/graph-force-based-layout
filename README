This is an Object Pascal (Delphi) implementation of a custom n-dimentional 
graph layout algorithm, heavily inspired by the Kamada-Kawai model.

Currently, the implementation is limited to representing 2D non-weighted
graphs, but the algorithm can be trivially adapted to N-dimensions and
weighted graphs.

Use Lazarus and Free Pascal to compile
